contents\n\nGetting Started\nLatest Update\nInstallation\nUsage\nAPI\nEvents\nDemo\n\nGetting Started\nngx-echarts is an Angular (ver >= 2.x) directive for ECharts (ver >= 3.x).\nLatest version @npm:\n\nv3.1.0 for Angular >= 6\nv2.2.0 for Angular \n\nGithub branches:\n\nmaster for Angular >= 6\nv2.x for Angular \n\nLatest Update\n\n2018.06.13: v3.1.0 & v2.2.0:\n\nNew: [autoResize] now detects its container element's offset width. Especially useful for charts inside  such as NG-ZORRO components.\n\n\n2018.06.12: v3.0.1 & v2.1.1:\n\nBugfix: Line chart is not animated on init. issue#102\n\n\n2018.05.08: v3.0.0:\n\nChange: Support Angular 6\nDocs: generate demo app by @angular/cli-6.0.0\n\n\n2018.03.14: v2.1.0\n\nNew: [loadingOpts] to customize loading style. Refer to API\nBugfix: double check dom.style.height before setting default value.\n\n\n2018.02.07: v2.0.2. New: [autoResize] input (default: true). PR #73 by arethore-actility\n\n2017.12.11: v2.0.1. Fix issue: No change detection involved in event handler. Refer to issue #26, #28\n\n2017.12.04: v2.0.0. Provide an echarts wrapper service: NgxEchartsService. Please see demo\n\n2017.11.25: v2.0.0-beta.0. It has some BREAKING CHANGES you should know.\n\n\nInstallation\n# if you use npm\nnpm install echarts --save\nnpm install ngx-echarts --save\n\n# or if you use yarn\nyarn add echarts\nyarn add ngx-echartsHow to use it within:\n\nangular-cli: If you already have an angular-cli project. You need to import echarts in the \"scripts\" list of angular-cli.json just like:\n\n{\n  // projects ...\n  \"architect\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\n+         \"node_modules/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nWebpack: You need to edit webpack.common.js, just like:\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n// ...\n\n// add this:\necharts: \"echarts\"\n})\nSystemJS: For example: angular quickstart. You need to modify systemjs.config.js file just like:\n\n\n{\n  map: {\n    // ...\n\n    // ngx-echarts\n    'echarts':                   'npm:echarts',\n    'ngx-echarts':          'npm:ngx-echarts'\n  },\n  packages: {\n    // other packages ...\n\n    // ngx-echarts\n    echarts: {\n      defaultExtension: 'js',\n      main: 'dist/echarts.min.js',\n      meta: {\n        './*.js': {\n          format: 'global', // load this module as a global\n          exports: 'echarts', // the global property to take as the module value\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    'ngx-echarts': {\n      defaultExtension: 'js',\n      main: 'bundles/ngx-echarts.umd.js',\n      meta: {\n        './*.js': {\n          deps: ['echarts']\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}Usage\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import NgxEchartsModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\n import { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\n @NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     ...,\n     NgxEchartsModule\n   ],\n   ...\n })\n export class AppModule { }\nThen: use echarts directive in a div which has pre-defined height. (From v2.0, it has default height: 400px)\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:\n\ncss:\n.demo-chart {\nheight: 400px;\n}\ncomponent:\nchartOption = {\ntitle: {\n  text: '堆叠区域图'\n},\ntooltip : {\n  trigger: 'axis'\n},\nlegend: {\n  data:['邮件营销','联盟广告','视频广告','直接访问','搜索引擎']\n},\ntoolbox: {\n  feature: {\n    saveAsImage: {}\n  }\n},\ngrid: {\n  left: '3%',\n  right: '4%',\n  bottom: '3%',\n  containLabel: true\n},\nxAxis : [\n  {\n    type : 'category',\n    boundaryGap : false,\n    data : ['周一','周二','周三','周四','周五','周六','周日']\n  }\n],\nyAxis : [\n  {\n    type : 'value'\n  }\n],\nseries : [\n  {\n    name:'邮件营销',\n    type:'line',\n    stack: '总量',\n    areaStyle: {normal: {}},\n    data:[120, 132, 101, 134, 90, 230, 210]\n  },\n  {\n    name:'联盟广告',\n    type:'line',\n    stack: '总量',\n    areaStyle: {normal: {}},\n    data:[220, 182, 191, 234, 290, 330, 310]\n  },\n  {\n    name:'视频广告',\n    type:'line',\n    stack: '总量',\n    areaStyle: {normal: {}},\n    data:[150, 232, 201, 154, 190, 330, 410]\n  },\n  {\n    name:'直接访问',\n    type:'line',\n    stack: '总量',\n    areaStyle: {normal: {}},\n    data:[320, 332, 301, 334, 390, 330, 320]\n  },\n  {\n    name:'搜索引擎',\n    type:'line',\n    stack: '总量',\n    label: {\n      normal: {\n        show: true,\n        position: 'top'\n      }\n    },\n    areaStyle: {normal: {}},\n    data:[820, 932, 901, 934, 1290, 1330, 1320]\n  }\n]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\nDirective\necharts directive support following input porperties:\n\n[options]: It's the same with the options in official demo site.\n\n[merge]: You can use it to update part of the options, especially helpful when you need to update the chart data. In fact, the value of merge will be used in echartsInstance.setOption() with notMerge = false. So you can refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n[loading]: boolean. Use it to toggle the echarts loading animation when your data is not ready.\n\n[autoResize]: boolean. Default: true. Charts will be automatically resized when container's width changed.\n\n[initOpts]: The value of [initOpts] will be used in echarts.init(). It may contain devicePixelRatio, renderer, width or height properties. Refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n[theme]: use it to init echarts with theme. You need to include the theme file in .angular-cli.json or other module resolver. \nFor example, if we want to use dark.js in Echarts Themes Page: \n  \n[loadingOpts]: Input an object to customize loading style. Refer to ECharts documentation for details. By default:\n{\n  text: 'loading',\n  color: '#c23531',\n  textColor: '#000',\n  maskColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',\n  zlevel: 0\n}\n\nIt exposes the echartsInstance (since v1.1.6) in (chartInit) event. So you can directly call the APIs just like: resize(), showLoading(), etc. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\ncomponent:\nonChartInit(ec) {\nthis.echartsIntance = ec;\n}\n\nresizeChart() {\nif (this.echartsIntance) {\n  this.echartsIntance.resize();\n}\n}\n\nService\nNgxEchartsService is a wrapper for global echarts object. You can get native echarts object or use wrapper method directly. For example:\n\nusage:\nimport {NgxEchartsService} from 'ngx-echarts';\n\n//...\nconstructor(private es: NgxEchartsService) {}\n\nngOnInit() {\n  const echarts = this.es.echarts;\n  echarts.registerMap('HK', HK_GEO_JSON);\n  // Or you can:\n  // this.es.registerMap('HK', HK_GEO_JSON);\n}\n\nMore details in Document and Demo\nEvents\nAs echarts support the 'click', 'dblclick', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', 'globalout' mouse events, our ngx-echarts directive also support the same mouse events but with additional chart prefix.\n\nhtml:\n\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that Echarts dispatches\n\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\nchartClick: It emits the same params of 'click' event\nchartDblClick: It emits the same params of 'dblclick' event\nchartMouseDown: It emits the same params of 'mousedown' event\nchartMouseUp: It emits the same params of 'mouseup' event\nchartMouseOver: It emits the same params of 'mouseover' event\nchartMouseOut: It emits the same params of 'mouseout' event\nchartGlobalOut: It emits the same params of 'globalout' event\nchartContextMenu: It emits the same params of 'contextmenu' event (since v1.2.1)\nchartDataZoom: It emits the same params of 'dataZoom' event (thanks to averhaegen)\n\nYou can refer to the echarts tutorial: Events and Actions in ECharts for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for the detailed example.\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
